THE END

GUESS YOURE STUCK HERE
UNTIL THE SONG ENDS

MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD
TIME TO THINK ABOUT ALL
THE THINGS YOU CAN DO
AFTER THE MUSIC IS OVER.

OR YOU COULD JUST STARE
AT THIS SCREEN

AND WATCH THESE MESSAGES
GO BY...

...AND WONDER JUST HOW LONG
WE WILL DRAG THIS OUT...

AND BELIEVE ME, WE CAN DRAG
IT OUT FOR QUITE A WHILE.

SHOULD BE OVER SOON...

ANY MOMENT NOW...



SEE YA
