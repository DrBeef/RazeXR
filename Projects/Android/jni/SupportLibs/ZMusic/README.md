# ZMusic
GZDoom's music system as a standalone library

Welcome! This repository is a library for use with the projects [GZDoom](https://github.com/coelckers/GZDoom), [Raze](https://github.com/coelckers/Raze), and the newer [PrBoom+](https://github.com/coelckers/prboom-plus).

Compile instructions are pretty simple for most systems.

```
git clone https://github.com/coelckers/ZMusic.git
mkdir ZMusic/build
cd ZMusic/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake . --build
```

On Unix/Linux you may also supply `sudo make install` in the build folder to push the compiled library directly into the file system so that it can be found by the previously mentioned projects.
